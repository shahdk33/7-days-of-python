# Day 2: Snake Game

# Date: May 26, 2023

## Main goal 
experiment with python GUI and get familiar with python basics by making a simple  game

## Areas of Improvement for future work 

1. high score system
2. button to restart or play again after game over
3. better UI rather than just squares and circles
4. different difficulty options at the begining (which would be different snake speeds)
