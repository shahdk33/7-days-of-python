# Day 6: Recipe App

# Date: June 16 2023

## Main goal 
Explore further with python and APIs to make an application which is useful for my everyday use. I am usually the one in the family to cook, and I get stuck sometimes finding a recipe that works with the ingredients I have. I struggle thinking of what to make with what I have on hand, so I made this program to help me find recipes based on what is available. 

## Future Work
Incorporate this backend logic with a framework to make it accessible as a web application with a User Interface.
