# Day 3: Simple Halifax Weather application Functionality

# Date: May 29, 2023

## Main goal 
Experiment with Weather API to fetch weather and other metrics in Nova Scotia with a simple Flask app

## Future Work
My main idea was to expand this for a wild-fire update type application because of the current situation in Nova Scotia. Residents are afraid and unsure of where to find updates. The important information is scattered around twitter, government websites, and other places online. I am thinking of a place to have all information plus notifications for users to ease their anxiety and have all the information.

1. API key is written in plain text on the code. Find a way to use the api key in a more secure way
2. Allow for user to input any city and country to find its weather rather than only display halifax
